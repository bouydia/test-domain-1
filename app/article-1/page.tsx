                The Power of Investigative Journalism

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                Investigative journalism represents the highest form of
                journalistic integrity and courage. It involves deep, systematic
                research into matters of public interest that powerful
                individuals or institutions would prefer to keep hidden. From
                Watergate to the Panama Papers, investigative journalists have
                exposed corruption, fraud, and abuse of power that have shaped
                the course of history.

                The Investigative Process
              </h3>

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                True investigative journalism follows a rigorous methodology: it
                begins with a hypothesis or tip, involves months or years of
                research, requires verification from multiple sources, and
                culminates in a comprehensive story that can withstand legal
                scrutiny. Investigative reporters often work undercover, build
                complex databases, and develop confidential sources to piece
                together the truth.

                Investigative journalists face numerous challenges: legal
                threats, physical danger, financial pressure, and attempts to
                discredit their work. Many work with limited resources, often as
                freelancers, and face the constant threat of lawsuits from
                powerful subjects. Despite these obstacles, their work remains
                essential to maintaining democracy and holding power to account.

              <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                The impact of investigative journalism can be profound and
                long-lasting. It can lead to criminal prosecutions, policy
                changes, corporate reforms, and increased public awareness.
                Perhaps most importantly, it serves as a deterrent, letting
                those in power know that their actions are being watched and
                that wrongdoing will be exposed.
